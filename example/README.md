## Getting Started

1. **Set up InstantDB Project**
   - Go to [instantdb.com](https://instantdb.com) and create an account
   - Create a new project and copy your App ID

2. **Configure Environment**
   - Create a `.env` file in the example directory
   - Add your InstantDB App ID:
     ```
     INSTANTDB_API_ID=your-app-id-here
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the App**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Debug Toggle Feature

The example app includes a **debug toggle button** in the app bar (bug icon) that allows you to control logging verbosity in real-time:

### Using the Debug Toggle

- **🐛 Filled bug icon**: Debug logging is enabled (detailed output)
- **🐛 Outlined bug icon**: Debug logging is disabled (production-friendly output)
- **Click to toggle**: Switch between debug and production logging modes
- **Persistent**: Your preference is saved and restored when you restart the app

### What It Does

**Debug Mode (ON):**
- Shows detailed WebSocket messages
- Logs query execution and results
- Displays sync operations and conflicts
- Provides transaction-level debugging
- Useful for development and troubleshooting

**Production Mode (OFF):**
- Shows only warnings and errors
- Clean console output
- Minimal performance impact
- Ready for end-user testing

### Technical Details

The toggle uses SharedPreferences to persist your choice and dynamically updates InstantDB's log level without requiring an app restart. This makes it perfect for testing and demonstrating the app to users while maintaining the ability to debug when needed.

## Testing Real-time Sync

To see the real-time synchronization in action:

1. Run the app on multiple devices/emulators simultaneously
2. Add, complete, or delete todos on one device
3. Watch as the changes appear instantly on all other devices!

You can also:
- Run multiple instances in different browser tabs (with `flutter run -d chrome`)
- Use physical devices and emulators side by side
- Open the app while someone else has it open to see collaborative editing

## How It Works

### Anonymous Mode (Default)

The todo app works immediately without any login:
- InstantDB automatically creates an anonymous session
- Todos sync across all devices/browsers using the same app ID
- No user accounts needed - perfect for demos and simple apps

### Optional Authentication

If you want user-specific todos, you can add authentication:
- See `auth_example.dart` for a complete implementation
- Users can sign up/sign in with email and password
- Each user gets their own private todo list
- The app gracefully handles both anonymous and authenticated states

## Key Code Concepts

### InstantDB Initialization

```dart
final db = await InstantDB.init(
  appId: 'your-app-id',
  config: const InstantConfig(
    syncEnabled: true, // Enable real-time sync
  ),
);
```

### Reactive Queries with InstantBuilder

```dart
InstantBuilderTyped<List<Map<String, dynamic>>>(
  query: {
    'todos': {
      'orderBy': {'createdAt': 'desc'},
    },
  },
  transformer: (data) => (data['todos'] as List).cast<Map<String, dynamic>>(),
  builder: (context, todos) {
    // UI automatically updates when todos change
    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: todos.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) => TodoTile(todo: todos[index]),
    );
  },
)
```

### Creating Data

```dart
await db.transact([
  ...db.create('todos', {
    'id': db.id(),
    'text': 'My new todo',
    'completed': false,
    'createdAt': DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch,
  }),
]);
```

### Updating Data

```dart
await db.transact([
  db.update(todoId, {
    'completed': !currentCompleted,
  }),
]);
```

### Deleting Data

```dart
await db.transact([
  db.delete(todoId),
]);
```

### Connection Status

```dart
ConnectionStatusBuilder(
  builder: (context, isOnline) {
    return Icon(
      isOnline ? Icons.cloud_done : Icons.cloud_off,
      color: isOnline ? Colors.green : Colors.red,
    );
  },
)
```

## Architecture

The app demonstrates several key InstantDB Flutter patterns:

- **InstantProvider**: Provides InstantDB instance to the widget tree
- **InstantBuilderTyped**: Reactive widget that rebuilds when query results change  
- **Signals**: Underlying reactivity system that powers real-time updates
- **Transactions**: Atomic operations that ensure data consistency
- **Local-first**: Data is stored locally and synced to the cloud

## Troubleshooting

**App won't connect to InstantDB:**
- Verify your App ID is correct in the `.env` file
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure you have the latest version of the package

**Changes not syncing between devices:**
- Ensure both devices are online (check the connection indicator)
- Verify both devices are using the same App ID
- Try refreshing/restarting the app

**Build errors:**
- Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
- Make sure you're using Flutter 3.27.0 or later
- Check that all dependencies are properly installed
